    <h3>Part 3 - Letter - Sample answer A</h3>
    <p style="font-size:60%; text-align: left">
        Dear Martin,<br/>
        That's great! your grandmother is very kind and nice.<br/>
        However, I can see you have a difficult desicion to make. If I were you I would try to use some of the money for the holiday and save the rest(although I don't know how much you have or how much the holiday costs). What do you think? The camera could be a good idea, but how often do you use a camera? And you can ask your friends to take photos on the holiday so you still have some!<br/>
        Anyway, write to me and tell me what you do.<br/>
        Love Martina.
