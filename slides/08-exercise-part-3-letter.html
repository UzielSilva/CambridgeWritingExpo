		Dear Martin,<br/>
		That's great! your grandmother is very kind and nice.<br/>
		However, I can see you have a difficult desicion to make. If I were you I would try to use some of the money for the holiday and save the rest(although I don't know how much you have or how much the holiday costs). What do you think? The camera could be a good idea, but how often do you use a camera? And you can ask your friends to take photos on the holiday so you still have some!<br/>
		Anyway, write to me and tell me what you do.<br/>
		Love Martina.
