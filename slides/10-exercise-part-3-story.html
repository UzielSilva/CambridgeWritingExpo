        A Lucky Escape<br/>
        When I was young, I saw a lucky escape. I was playing in the garden with some friends who lived in the same street, when a police car arrived. We were a bit scared and didn't know why the car had come to my house. Maybe they were checking something or looking for someone.<br/>
        The policeman got out and started speaking to one of my friends.<br/>
        While the policeman was asking questions, I suddenly saw a strange person going out at the back of my neighbour's house. My neighbour was on holiday, so the house was empty. I had never seen this person before. Suddenly he started to run. I didn't know what to do, so I shouted to the police, but the man could run very fast and he got away. That was a lucky escape!

            A range of simple and complex grammatical forms is used with a good degree of control. There is effective use of a good range of narrative tenses (<i>I was playing in the garden ... when a police car arrived; ... didn't know why the car had come to my house</i>).<br/>
            Errors are minimal and do not impede communication</p>

So this I did but teacher sudenly looked and nearly catched me but I had lucky escape becos she didn't see me looking at boy near me, just I writting.<br/>
